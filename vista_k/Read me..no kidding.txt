This is info file about vista_k theme made by aphex@aphexthemes.com

Fixes 29Nov. 2007:


-added missing property to blocks contents for IE browsers
-added extra css codes strictly for news article
-added template "news_item.html" for better integration of the articles in the theme
-minor alignments issues 


---------------------/////////////------------------------





Header links:

Since the theme file has separate codes to function well on all major browsers the links in the header need to be set twice, thats
right TWICE!!!

one time for IE series  and the second time for all the other browsers

Theme has separate codes because IE6 and older can't make transparency of png files

So...PAY ATTENTION at hrefs id :

<a href="#" id="articles">  means this is the link for the first button in this case "Articles"

now if you scroll down right after the first <!--[if IE]><![if !IE]><![endif]--> you will find its "other then IE" duplicate.

If i'm to set a real link for articles i will have to eddit both instants otherwise link will work either only on IE either on other browsers


Footer: footer image cotains a "theme by aphex" which is actualy part of the footer image, you may NOT delete nor recreate the image
to have it without that text, to do that you will have to contact me!

Thats it 

Enjoy.

Ah...btw....header PSD is included in the package for customization of links ;)
